Description: Rust systems programming language
 Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language. It visually
 resembles the C language family, but differs significantly in syntactic
 and semantic details. Its design is oriented toward concerns of
 "programming in the large", that is, of creating and maintaining
 boundaries - both abstract and operational - that preserve large-system
 integrity, availability and concurrency.
